### 2026-11-12/13 · M01 · Scaffold, tooling and CI

**Outcome.** All four acceptance criteria met. `composer verify` is green locally, from a fresh clone (`composer setup`) and in CI: 48 tests, 157 assertions, Larastan level 7 with 0 errors.

**What was done, file by file**

*Quality gate and scripts*
- `composer.json`: `verify` script runs, in order, `pint --test` → `phpstan analyse` → `npm run build` → `npm run types:check` → `npm run check` → `pest --parallel`. The build comes first because it generates the Wayfinder TS files (needed by `tsc`) and the Vite manifest (needed by the browser test). Scripts trimmed to `setup`, `dev`, `lint` (Pint fix), `verify`. A `conflict` keeps `brianium/paratest` below 7.28.
- `package.json`: kit script names kept (`build`, `dev`, `check`, `check:fix`, `types:check`); `playwright` added as a dev dependency.
- `vite.config.ts`: Markdown, `design/**` and `.claude/**` excluded from `vp fmt`; `design/**` excluded from `vp lint`.

*Tests*
- `phpunit.xml`: `Arch` and `Browser` test suites; `DB_DATABASE=tournament_preflight_test`; `INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED=false`. No `APP_KEY`: tests use the key in `.env`.
- `tests/TestCase.php`: `Http::preventStrayRequests()` in `setUp()`, so any unfaked outgoing request fails the test.
- `tests/Pest.php`: `Feature` and `Browser` use `TestCase` + `RefreshDatabase`; kit placeholders removed.
- `tests/Arch/ArchTest.php`: Pest `php` and `security` presets, plus no `dd`/`dump`/`ray`/`ddd`/`var_dump` in classes (AC3).
- `tests/Arch/NoDebugCallsInFilesTest.php`: the same ban for `routes/`, `config/`, `bootstrap/` and Blade views, which `arch()` cannot see.
- `tests/Feature/StrayRequestsTest.php`: asserts the guard is on, then that an unfaked `Http::get()` throws (AC4).
- `tests/Feature/TimezoneTest.php`: config and PHP both run in UTC (rule 4).
- `tests/Browser/SmokeTest.php`: opens `/` in Chromium; asserts the title contains the app name and there are no JS errors or console logs.
- `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php` removed (`true is true`); `tests/Unit/.gitkeep` keeps the folder.

*Configuration*
- `.env.example`: `APP_NAME=Pre-Flight`, `APP_TIMEZONE=UTC` (with a "keep UTC" note), test database note.
- `config/app.php`: timezone read from `APP_TIMEZONE` (default `UTC`).
- `config/inertia.php`: SSR read from `INERTIA_SSR_ENABLED` (default `true`).
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: runs on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`, skips docs-only changes, cancels superseded runs. PHP 8.4, MySQL 8.4 service, Chromium, then `composer verify`.
- `.gitignore`: `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/` are tracked; only `.claude/settings.local.json` is ignored.

*Claude kit and docs*
- `.claude/commands/rethink-tests.md` (new) and the `/rethink-tests` step in `workflow.md`, `start-milestone.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. `/wrap-up` now writes this kind of documentation-ready log.
- `.claude/hooks/format.sh`: formats TS/CSS/JSON with `vp fmt` (Prettier is not installed); Markdown no longer auto-formatted.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/milestones/M01-scaffold.md`: aligned with the installed kit (Pest 5, Larastan 7, Vite+, Tailwind kept, Herd + DBngin, `composer setup`); Tailwind-teaching and slow-tests notes in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `docs/decisions.md`: 15+ entries (versions and every choice above).

**Problems hit and how they were solved**
- *`pest --parallel` crashed* (`TypeError` in Pest's `WrapperRunner`): paratest 7.28 changed `SuiteLoader::$tests` to nested arrays; Pest 5.3.5 (latest) expects strings. Pinned paratest below 7.28 with a composer `conflict`.
- *41 tests failed with "No application encryption key"*: local `.env` had no key. First fixed with a test key in `phpunit.xml`; GitGuardian flagged it, so it was removed and `composer setup` (`key:generate`) is now the documented path.
- *12 tests failed only while `composer dev` ran*: Inertia SSR posted every render to the Vite dev server (`public/hot`), and the stray-request guard blocked it. SSR is off in tests.
- *`vp check` failed on docs, the prototype and `.claude/settings.json`*: excluded from formatting and linting.
- *First `dd()` experiment crashed the runner*: it was in a service provider, which runs on boot. Moved to a controller to see the real arch failure.
- *`main` had never been pushed*: GitHub made `m01-scaffold` the default branch and PR creation failed. Pushed `main` unchanged and set it as default.
- *`tournamentpreflight.test` did not resolve*: Herd's dnsmasq was not running. Bruno restarted Herd services; the site answers 200.
- *CI ran twice per commit*: `push` on all branches plus `pull_request`. Now `pull_request` + `push` to `main`.

**`/rethink-tests` outcome.** Every M01 test was walked through with Bruno. Experiments showed two real holes: a `dd()` in `routes/web.php` passed the arch test, and the smoke test passed on a 500 error page. Accepted all five proposals: P1 debug-call scan for non-class files, P2 guard checked before the request, P3 title assertion in the smoke test, P4 UTC test, P5 remove the placeholder unit test. Each new test was shown failing on a deliberately broken app first. Rejected: none.

**Review outcome.** `code-reviewer` found two must-fix items (AC1 and `decisions.md` inconsistent after the key removal), both fixed. Optional items done: CI duplicates, docs text, scripts. Declined by Bruno: `config.platform.php`, permission hardening in `.claude/settings.json`, tracking `boost.json`.

**What is left**
- PR #2 (review fixes, CI triggers, stronger tests, this wrap-up) to merge.
- Bruno: mark the GitGuardian incident for the old test key as resolved (it is in `main`'s history via the regular merge of PR #1; the key was never used).
- Bruno: set `APP_NAME=Pre-Flight` and `APP_URL=http://tournamentpreflight.test` in local `.env`.

**Surprising**
- The stray-request guard paid off on day one: it exposed Inertia SSR calling the dev server during tests.
- Pest 5.3.5 and paratest 7.28 are incompatible on release; worth checking on each `composer update`.

## Found along the way

<!-- Problems or ideas outside the current milestone. Each gets a milestone or "later". -->

- **Paratest pin**: remove the `conflict` on `brianium/paratest` when Pest supports 7.28+. (later)
- **Starter kit demo pages** (`dashboard`, `settings`, password auth pages and their 44 tests) are still in place; replace or remove in M06 with the new auth.
- ~~Summary agent~~: decided 13 Nov, `/wrap-up` writes the full summary instead.
